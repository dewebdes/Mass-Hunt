oh, we set http-only cookie via xss-reflection bug in response



The search endpoint reflects user input directly into the HTTP response.

It does so without sanitizing special characters, including carriage return (%0d) and line feed (%0a).

This allows an attacker to inject a Set-Cookie header into the victimâ€™s browser.



ðŸ”¥ Real Exploit Flow
Attacker logs in, captures their own csrfKey and CSRF token.

Attacker crafts a reflected input (e.g., via search endpoint) that injects csrfKey into the victimâ€™s browser.

Attacker hosts a CSRF PoC that uses the matching CSRF token.

Victim visits the attackerâ€™s page while logged in.

Browser sends victimâ€™s session + attackerâ€™s csrfKey + attackerâ€™s CSRF token.

Server accepts the request â†’ email changed.
